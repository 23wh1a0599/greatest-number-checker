This HTML and JavaScript program allows users to enter three numbers and find out which one is the greatest. The web page contains three input fields labeled "Enter Number-1", "Enter Number-2", and "Enter Number-3", followed by a button labeled "Find Greatest". When the button is clicked, the findGreatest() function is executed. This function reads the values from the input fields using getElementById and converts them into integers using parseInt(). It initially assumes the first number (num1) is the greatest and stores it in the variable max. Then it compares this value with num2 and num3, updating max whenever a larger number is found. After determining the largest value, it updates the <h1> element with the ID result to display the message indicating which number is the greatest. This program demonstrates basic user input handling, number comparison using conditional statements, and DOM manipulation with JavaScript.
